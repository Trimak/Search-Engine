# Search-Engine

This is a read me or I guess introductory file that I dont understand.

This document looks like code but i'm trying to figure out what this is actualyl for in the form of a read me.

So this project is a web search engine. The idea is for it to be written in Python and using a completely distributed architecture.

At current there is little to no unique code, rather open source code found which will form the basis of the crawler. This is due to me not actually knowing Python. I am still trying to make sense of the bigger picture of the programming side. I need to also figure out a database to store the URL lists and index so that the project can be taken offline and resume progress.
