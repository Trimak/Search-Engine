# Search-Engine

This project is a web search engine. The idea is for it to be written in Python and using a completely distributed architecture.

At current there is little to no unique code, rather open source code found which will form the basis of the crawler. This is due to me not actually knowing Python. I am still trying to make sense of the bigger picture of the programming side. I need to also figure out a database to store the URL lists and index so that the project can be taken offline and resume progress.

Also, as a distributed system like P2P or Bitcoin. It needs to be centrally administrated as necessary. I am at present not sure how to achieve this.

The information is scattered at the moment here, in the issues section, in the wiki and in my personal business plan. I will clean this up as I get a firmer grasp on where I feel the information should be.
